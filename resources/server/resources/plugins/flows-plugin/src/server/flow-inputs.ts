/**
 * Read-only reader for a flow's declared `inputs:` schema.
 *
 * Parses `<cwd>/.pi/flows/flows/<ns>/<name>/flow.yaml` and returns the
 * declared flow-level inputs (name + type + required). This is the source of
 * truth the automation input-wiring UI renders from. It NEVER writes a flow
 * file — the automation side only reads the flow's input contract.
 *
 * Mirrors pi-flows' `FlowInputDecl` shape (`flow-typed-io-and-run-state`)
 * without a compile dependency on the pi-flows package.

 * See change: wire-flow-inputs-in-automation.
